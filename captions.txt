# Aortic enlargement
a chest radiograph showing dilated aortic arch with widened mediastinum
prominent aortic knob with unfolding of the thoracic aorta
aortic enlargement with calcified atherosclerotic plaques

# Atelectasis
linear opacity with volume loss in the left lower lobe consistent with atelectasis
elevated hemidiaphragm with subsegmental atelectasis
plate-like atelectasis in the lung bases with compensatory hyperinflation

# Calcification
pulmonary granuloma with central calcification in the right upper lobe
calcified pleural plaques along the diaphragmatic surfaces
aortic arch calcification with atherosclerotic changes

# Cardiomegaly
cardiomegaly with cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 0.5
enlarged cardiac silhouette with prominent left ventricular contour
globular cardiac enlargement with pulmonary venous congestion

# Consolidation
lobar consolidation with air bronchograms in the right middle lobe
patchy alveolar opacities consistent with bronchopneumonia
round pneumonia in the left lower lobe of a pediatric patient

# ILD
reticulonodular pattern with basilar predominance suggestive of interstitial lung disease
ground-glass opacities with subpleural sparing in fibrotic ILD
traction bronchiectasis with honeycombing in advanced pulmonary fibrosis

# Infiltration
ill-defined perihilar infiltrates with bronchovascular distribution
multifocal patchy opacities suggestive of viral pneumonitis
asymmetric alveolar infiltrates without air bronchograms

# Lung Opacity
non-specific lung opacity in the right mid zone requiring further characterization
focal asymmetric opacity without volume loss in the left upper lobe
ill-defined pulmonary opacity with adjacent architectural distortion

# Nodule/Mass
a 12mm spiculated pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe suspicious for malignancy
well-circumscribed solitary pulmonary nodule with smooth margins
a large hilar mass with adjacent lymphadenopathy

# Other lesion
non-specific pulmonary abnormality requiring correlation with clinical history
atypical radiographic finding not fitting classical patterns
incidental thoracic finding of uncertain significance

# Pleural effusion
blunting of the left costophrenic angle with meniscus sign
large layering pleural effusion obscuring the hemidiaphragm
bilateral pleural effusions with mediastinal shift

# Pleural thickening
diffuse pleural thickening with calcifications along the lateral chest wall
apical pleural capping consistent with previous granulomatous disease
focal pleural thickening adjacent to parenchymal scarring

# Pneumothorax
a thin visceral pleural line with absent lung markings in the right apex
a large left-sided pneumothorax with mediastinal shift to the right
subtle pneumothorax visible only on expiratory view

# Pulmonary fibrosis
basal-predominant reticulation with traction bronchiectasis
honeycombing pattern in the lower lobes consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia
coarse interstitial markings with subpleural fibrosis

# No finding
normal chest radiograph with clear lung fields and sharp costophrenic angles
no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities identified
a technically adequate study without evidence of active disease
